-2048 is a 2048 game with new mechanics like **negative numbers**, **solid blocks**, **zipper blocks** and many more!

**Merge** same-numbered **blocks** together in this puzzle game to make them **twice as large**, don't mess up your board or you might run out of moves! 

This is my first Pygame project, it is still work-in-progress.

## Instructions

- Navigate UI with ``arrows`` or ``mouse``.
- Move your blocks using ``arrow keys``.

If you want to toy around with the new mechanics (not yet implemented in levels):
- ``Numpad 0`` to spawn a **solid block**.
- ``P`` to spawn a **negating block** (WIP).
